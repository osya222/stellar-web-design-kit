      This is a placeholder component for API documentation.
      To implement file uploads in a production environment:
      
      1. Set up a server-side API endpoint at /api/upload that:
         - Receives multipart/form-data
         - Extracts the file and fileName from the request
         - Saves the file to /public/images/products/{fileName}
         - Returns a 200 status code on success
      
      2. For local development, you may need to set up a proxy in vite.config.ts
         to forward /api requests to your API server.
      
      3. When deploying, ensure your server has write permissions to the /public/images/products/ directory.
